  <h1>The 6–7 Phenomenon</h1>

  <p>
    Every era believes it is immune to manipulation.  
    History suggests otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across centuries, cultures, and systems of power, a recurring numerical pattern
    has appeared quietly at moments of transition, unrest, and control.
    It is often dismissed. Sometimes mocked.
    Occasionally archived and forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pattern is known—informally—as <em>6–7</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Excerpt from the Archive</h2>

  <p>What changed was not the pattern.</p>
  <p>It was the audience.</p>

  <p>
    By the late 1990s, the sequence no longer appeared in controlled studies or internal memoranda.
    It surfaced in open systems—broadcast schedules, campaign cycles, entertainment releases.
    Always plausibly accidental. Always statistically defensible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Six exposures to soften resistance.<br>
    The seventh to anchor belief.
  </p>

  <p>
    Internal correspondence from this period avoids moral language entirely.
    Instead, it favours operational terms: uptake, retention, normalisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those in positions of authority did not need to invent a tool of control.
    <br>
    They only needed to recognise one.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>“At scale, distinction between influence and governance collapses.”</em>
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Read before you dismiss it</h2>

  <p>
    This is a work of fiction.
    It does not tell you what to think.
    It simply presents a pattern and asks whether coincidence is the only explanation.
