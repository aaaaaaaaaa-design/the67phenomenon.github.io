  <h1>The 6–7 Phenomenon</h1>

  <p>
    Every era believes it is immune to manipulation.  
    History suggests otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across centuries, cultures, and systems of power, a recurring numerical pattern
    has appeared quietly at moments of transition, unrest, and control.
    It is often dismissed. Sometimes mocked.
    Occasionally archived and forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pattern is known—informally—as <em>6–7</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>What this is</h2>

  <p>
    This project documents a <strong>fictional exploration</strong> of the origins,
    symbolism, and modern re-emergence of the 6–7 phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
    It traces imagined links between ancient ritual structures,
    early mathematical mysticism, and contemporary methods of influence.
    No single claim stands alone.
    The concern lies in the repetition.
  </p>

  <h2>Why it matters</h2>

  <p>
    In the modern age, influence no longer requires force.
    It requires familiarity.
    Repetition.
    Symbols that appear harmless until they are everywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    The book asks a simple question:
    <br><br>
    <strong>If this is only fiction, why does it align so neatly with reality?</strong>
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Read before you dismiss it</h2>

  <p>
    This is not a manifesto.
    It does not tell you what to think.
    It simply lays out a pattern and invites you to decide whether it is coincidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Parents, educators, and citizens have a responsibility to understand
    how narratives are shaped—especially the ones that arrive disguised as entertainment.
